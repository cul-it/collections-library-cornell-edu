It is a strategic definition that is still used by the region's leaders in the&nbsp;<a title="ASEAN web site" href="http://www.aseansec.org/">Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)</a>. This strategic area was conceived as extending from eastern India and southwest China to the northern shore of Australia, then along the eastern face of the Philippines. Included in the region are the nations of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
