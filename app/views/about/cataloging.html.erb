		<h2>Cataloging and Metadata</h2>
		<p>Descriptive metadata for the project will be derived from existing MARC records or created and entered by project staff (for illustrations and maps) and will be encoded using the TEI Lite standard.</p>
		<p>The project is designed to provide individual access to 10,000 illustrations and maps. Descriptive metadata for these images will be kept as simple as possible while still meeting the anticipated needs of the users of the digitized collection by emphasizing the importance of retrieving illustrations and maps associated with specific locales. Data elements will include caption, geographic name, and personal name (when available for portraits).</p>
