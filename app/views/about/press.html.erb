  	<h3>IMLS Funds SE Asia Digital Collection</h3>
      <p>FOR RELEASE: 13 November, 2002 Ithaca, NY -- Cornell University 
        Library has received a grant of $281,449 from the federal 
        Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for a two-year 
        project to digitize early Western travel narratives from 
        the library&#8217;s John M. Echols Collection on Southeast 
        Asia.</p>
      <p>Directed by Allen J. Riedy, curator of Cornell Library&#8217;s 
        renowned Echols Collection, the &quot;Images of Southeast 
        Asia&quot; project represents the first large-scale initiative 
        worldwide to create a digital collection of Southeast Asian 
        library material. The resulting digital collection will 
        comprise a significant representation of English language 
        first-person accounts of life in Southeast Asia before 1927.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with the library&#8217;s divisions of 
        Digital Library and Information Technologies and of Rare 
        and Manuscript Collections, the full contents of 400 monographs 
        and 150 periodical articles from the Journal of the Royal 
        Geographical Society and Le Tour du Monde will be scanned 
        and made available in a full-text database. The resulting 
        digital collection will include some 140,000 pages of text 
        and 10,000 illustrations taken from early Western travel 
        narratives.</p>
      <p>With holdings totaling more than 370,000 titles, the John 
        M. Echols Collection is the largest collection on Southeast 
        Asia in the United States. More than half of the collection 
        comprises volumes in the vernacular languages of the region&#8212;Indonesian, 
        Thai, Vietnamese, Burmese, Malaysian, Khmer, Laotian, and 
        the languages of the Philippines. The collection&#8217;s 
        Dutch, French, and Spanish holdings are uniquely strong 
        and date back to early colonial periods of the region.</p>
