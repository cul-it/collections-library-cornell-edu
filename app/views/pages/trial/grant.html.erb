<h2>Grant Project and Description</h2>
<p>In 2011 the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/hps/treasures/index.htm">Save America&#8217;s Treasures grant program</a> provided funding of $155,700 to enable Cornell University Library to restore and digitize this collection of mass-produced pamphlets. The <a href="http://law.library.cornell.edu/">Cornell University Law Library</a> purchased the Trials Pamphlet Collection in 1927, when the pamphlets were bound together and created a volume that was difficult to use. This was common knowledge  about proper preservation techniques. Many of the bound volumes have deteriorated and the original pamphlets&#8217; brittle pages are damaged, making them impossible for researchers to use.  As a result of conservation treatment, the volumes will be individually bound, cleaned and made chemically stable.</p>

<p>Each pamphlet will also be completely digitized and indexed online, allowing access to them both in person and online. All conservation and digitization work will be done in-house at Cornell.</p>
<p>This is Cornell&#8217;s third Save America&#8217;s Treasures award. These grants have been administered by the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> and the National Park Service through the federal <a href="http://www.nps.gov/hps/treasures/index.htm">Save America&#8217;s Treasures grant program</a>, which supported the preservation of significant cultural heritage collections, sites and historic structures in the United States.</p>
