<h2>Rare Books</h2>
<p>The Rare Book collection of the Cornell Law Library serves to   maintain the historical continuity of the study of law, and to provide   the provenance on which the current literature is based. The Library has   collected early and rare books throughout its history, and makes the   collection available to researchers.</p>

<p>The collection consists of several thousand volumes, primarily   English and continental European materials, including many 16th- and   17th-century works. It includes the Samuel Thorne Collection, 175 of the   earliest and rarest books on law. Other books in the collection have   been drawn from a number of sources, including the Nathaniel C. Moak   library and the Edwin J. Marshall Collection of early works on equity.</p>
<p>The collection is strongest in the area of Anglo-American law.   However, early and/or rare works on U.S. and European civil law are also   well represented as evidenced by a number of important early works of   French law, as well as early printed editions of Roman and feudal law.   The collection of materials on British law is particularly rich in   reports and abridgements from the Tudor-Stuart period, as well as   editions of Coke's Institutes and Blackstone's Commentaries.</p>
<p>Early editions of works on practice and pleading, conveyance, as well   as sources and treatises on Chancery, are also well represented. Of   particular note are early editions of treatises such as Bracton, Fleta,   Fortescue, and Littleton, as well as the abridgements of Fitzherbert and   Brooke.</p><p>If you have any questions about using Rare Books at the Cornell Law Library, please consult our <a href="http://law.library.cornell.edu/about/policies/rarebooks">Rare Books policy</a>.</p>
