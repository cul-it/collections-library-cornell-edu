		 <strong><a href="http://www.ilo.org/" target="ilo">International Labour Organization</a></strong><br />
		 Cornell Law Library helped create the first web site of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), after a visit at the ICJ in the Hague in the summer of 1996. Jay Greco, JD '98, spent a summer at the Court and provided advice. He then did the same thing for the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Geneva, Switzerland. The then ILO webmaster in turn visited Cornell. Cornell Law Library subsequently created mirror sites for both the ICJ and the ILO, creating redundancy much needed at the time to support heavy web use of these sites.</p>
